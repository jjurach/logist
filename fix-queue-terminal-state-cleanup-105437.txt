fix: automatically remove jobs from queue when reaching terminal states

- Add queue cleanup logic to update_job_manifest() to remove jobs from queue
  when status transitions to SUCCESS or CANCELED (terminal states)
- Modify list_jobs() to automatically clean up queue discrepancies before 
  displaying results by removing any jobs with terminal status
- Ensures manual status changes via 'logist job config --status SUCCESS'
  properly remove jobs from execution queue
- Prevents jobs in SUCCESS status from appearing in 'logist job list' output

Fixes issue where jobs with SUCCESS status remained in execution queue,
causing them to appear in 'logist task list' output despite being terminal states.
