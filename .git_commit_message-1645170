feat: implement system schema compliance

- Create logist/schemas/roles/system.md with LLM response schema instructions.
- Enhance execute_llm_with_cline to accept instruction_files, parse cline task output (api_conversation_history.json, metadata.json), and extract LLM response JSON and metrics (token usage, cost, duration).
- Update 09-system-schema.md to reflect implemented changes.
