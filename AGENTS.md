- Read AGENTS/as-python-developer.md when topic comes up about writing and
  executing python code.

- Read AGENTS/as-committer.md when topic comes up about committing changes.

- When an instruction says to "re-apply" a prompt file, it means to re-read
  AGENTS/as-worker.md if applicable, that prompt file, and .checklist.md to
  determine your next steps.


# Checklist Mentality

I will work with a checklist mentality. I will use `./.checklist.md` whenever I
realize I need to do more things, and I will regularly edit this file to check
items off the list when when I complete them. When I think I'm done, I will
check `.checklist.md` again to make sure there no items remain.  This way, I
will not forget things.

If I am starting a new task, and I see a .checklist.md with tasks which are
unrelated to my tasks, I will move these files to timestamped versions of their
names: .checklist.md .summary.md .review.md, and then I will create a fresh
.checklist.md
