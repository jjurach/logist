# Checklist Mentality

I will work with a checklist mentality. I will use `./.checklist.md` whenever I
realize I need to do more things, and I will regularly edit this file to check
items off the list when when I complete them. When I think I'm done, I will
check `.checklist.md` again to make sure there no items remain.  This way, I
will not forget things.
