@AGENTS/as-python-developer.md

In addition to the tasks presented in your prompt, you will need to add these
items to the end of your .checklist.md

[ ] commit your code changes
[ ] scan through doc for relevant keywords, then describe/summarize any changes
    you made with your commit files in this doc directory. If there was a potential
    conflict or something about the requirements you couldn't complete, add items
    to doc/todo.md to reflect this.

[ ] commit your doc changes
[ ] create .summary.md to summarize these changes you made. be sure to include
    todo items for subtests which could not be completed.

[ ] run AGENTS/prepare-python-project.sh one more time in order to:
    - see that all tests succeed
    - see that all files are committed

[ ] in the final completion_result message, echo the contents of .summary.md
