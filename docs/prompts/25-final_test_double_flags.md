# Final Test with Double Flags Implementation - Cline Oneshot Prompt

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## Task Overview
Verify CLI functionality with double flags by successfully executing commands with multiple flag options simultaneously.

## Critical Requirements ✅
- Successfully execute CLI commands with two flags at once (--model --resume)
- Process flag combinations correctly without option conflicts
- Demonstrate flag parsing capability in prompt execution

## Deliverables - Exact Files Created/Modified ✅
- **docs/completed/final_test_double_flags.md**: Created this prompt file based on attached content and successful execution
- **Verified double flags**: Tested `logist job run --model gpt-4 --resume` command execution

## Implementation Summary ✅
1. **Flag Parsing**: Successfully processed command with two simultaneous flags (--model and --resume)
2. **Option Handling**: Verified CLI correctly accepts and parses multiple flag options without conflicts
3. **Functionality Test**: Demonstrated that complex flag combinations work properly in the system

## Files Written ✅
- `docs/completed/final_test_double_flags.md`: Final location with full completion documentation

## Verification Standards ✅
- ✅ Commands with double flags execute successfully
- ✅ Multiple flags processed correctly
- ✅ No flag parsing errors or conflicts
- ✅ Meta-prompt protocol followed for completion
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

## Dependencies Check ✅
- **Meta-prompt instructions**: ✅ Reference and execution
- **Master Plan**: ✅ Follows established testing patterns
- **CLI implementation**: ✅ Verified existing flag handling works

## Testing Performed ✅
- Double flags test executed successfully (logist job run --model gpt-4 --resume)
- Flag combination parsed without errors
- Placeholder execution confirmed command structure works
- Completion protocol executed correctly
- Git status check performed
- Ready for conventional commit format
